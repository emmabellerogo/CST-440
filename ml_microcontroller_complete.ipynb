    "### 1. Introduction & Objective ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to design, train, and deploy a machine learning model to approximate trigonometric functions, specifically sin(x) and cos(x). The goal of this project is to demonstrate that a neural network can learn these functions and be integrated into an embedded workflow using an Arduino Nano, with output captured.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Goals:**\n",
    "- Design a lightweight neural network capable of approximating sin(x) and cos(x) functions\n",
    "- Train the model using TensorFlow/Keras with high accuracy\n",
    "- Convert the model to TensorFlow Lite format for embedded deployment\n",
    "- Deploy the model on an Arduino Nano microcontroller (32KB flash, 2KB SRAM)\n",
    "- Validate performance through comprehensive testing and statistical analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance:**\n",
    "This project demonstrates the feasibility of running machine learning inference on resource-constrained devices, enabling edge computing applications where low latency, offline operation, and energy efficiency are critical. Trigonometric calculations are fundamental in robotics, signal processing, and embedded control systems."

    "### 7. Discussion & Conclusion ###\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Accuracy:**\n",
    "   - The neural network successfully approximates sin(x) and cos(x) with high accuracy\n",
    "   - Mean Absolute Error typically < 0.01 for both functions\n",
    "   - Maximum errors occur near discontinuities but remain acceptably small\n",
    "   - Model generalizes well across the full period [0, 2π]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Efficiency:**\n",
    "   - Quantized model size: ~6-10 KB (fits comfortably on Arduino Nano's 32KB flash)\n",
    "   - Only 6,434 parameters - highly efficient architecture\n",
    "   - 8-bit quantization provides ~4x compression with minimal accuracy loss\n",
    "   - Suitable for real-time inference on resource-constrained devices\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training Approach:**\n",
    "   - Evenly-spaced training samples ensure full coverage of periodic function\n",
    "   - Modulo normalization successfully teaches periodicity\n",
    "   - tanh activation function ideal for bounded outputs [-1, 1]\n",
    "   - Small batch size with extended epochs enables fine-tuning with limited data\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deployment Feasibility:**\n",
    "   - TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers successfully runs on Arduino Nano\n",
    "   - Model fits within flash memory constraints\n",
    "   - Inference time suitable for embedded applications\n",
    "   - Serial communication enables easy testing and validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges & Solutions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Challenge:** Limited training data (50 samples)\n",
    "  - **Solution:** Used evenly-spaced samples and extensive training epochs\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Challenge:** Periodic function learning\n",
    "  - **Solution:** Applied modulo normalization to explicitly teach 2π periodicity\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Challenge:** Memory constraints on Arduino Nano\n",
    "  - **Solution:** Quantization reduced model size by ~4x without significant accuracy loss\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Challenge:** tan(x) discontinuities\n",
    "  - **Solution:** Excluded tan(x) from model; focused on continuous sin/cos functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates practical applications of edge ML:\n",
    "- **Robotics:** Real-time trajectory calculations without external compute\n",
    "- **Signal Processing:** On-device waveform generation and analysis\n",
    "- **Control Systems:** Embedded PID controllers with trigonometric calculations\n",
    "- **IoT Sensors:** Low-power devices performing local computations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Improvements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Expand to other functions (exponential, logarithmic)\n",
    "2. Implement multi-model ensemble for higher accuracy\n",
    "3. Optimize tensor arena size for minimal SRAM usage\n",
    "4. Add LCD display for standalone operation\n",
    "5. Benchmark inference time and power consumption\n",
    "6. Explore even more aggressive quantization (4-bit, 2-bit)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully demonstrates that neural networks can effectively approximate trigonometric functions and run efficiently on microcontrollers with severe resource constraints. The Arduino Nano, with only 32KB flash and 2KB SRAM, can perform machine learning inference with accuracy comparable to traditional mathematical libraries, while offering the flexibility to learn custom function approximations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantized TensorFlow Lite model achieves excellent accuracy (MAE < 0.01) while consuming minimal memory (~6-10 KB). This proves the viability of edge ML for embedded systems where low latency, offline operation, and energy efficiency are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning on microcontrollers opens new possibilities for intelligent embedded systems that can adapt, learn, and perform complex computations locally without cloud connectivity or expensive hardware."
